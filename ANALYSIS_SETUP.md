This guide explains how to set up the complete working beauty and outfit analysis system using Google Vision API and GPT.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real Beauty Analysis**: Uses Google Vision API to detect facial features and GPT to provide personalized beauty scores and recommendations
- **Smart Outfit Analysis**: Analyzes clothing items, color harmony, fit, and event appropriateness
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Personalized tips based on user profile and analysis results
- **Celebrity Matches**: Find celebrity lookalikes (beauty analysis)

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get your Google Vision API key:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Vision API
   - Go to Credentials and create an API key
   - Copy the API key to your `.env` file

3. Update `.env` file:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Dependencies

The following dependencies are already installed:
- `expo-file-system` - For image processing
- `expo-camera` - For photo capture
- `expo-image-picker` - For gallery selection

### 3. Analysis Flow

#### Beauty Analysis:
1. **Photo Capture**: User takes selfie or selects from gallery
2. **Vision API**: Detects facial features, landmarks, and image properties
3. **GPT Analysis**: Processes Vision API results with user profile to generate:
   - Glow score (1-10)
   - Individual scores (skin quality, symmetry, eye beauty, lip definition)
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Celebrity matches (optional)

#### Outfit Analysis:
1. **Photo Capture**: User takes full-body photo or selects from gallery
2. **Event Selection**: User specifies the occasion (work, date, party, etc.)
3. **Vision API**: Detects clothing items, colors, and objects
4. **GPT Analysis**: Processes results with event context to generate:
   - Style score (1-10)
   - Color harmony score
   - Fit & style assessment
   - Event appropriateness score
   - Styling suggestions
   - Color palette extraction

## ðŸ“± Usage

### Beauty Analysis
```typescript
import { analysisService } from '@/services/analysisService';

const result = await analysisService.analyzeBeautyPhoto(imageUri, userProfile);
// Returns: BeautyAnalysisResult with scores and recommendations
```

### Outfit Analysis
```typescript
import { analysisService } from '@/services/analysisService';

const result = await analysisService.analyzeOutfitPhoto(imageUri, event, userProfile);
// Returns: OutfitAnalysisResult with scores and suggestions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Analysis Criteria
